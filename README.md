# TextVenture  
*A Text-Based Adventure Game*

TextVenture is an interactive storytelling game where players explore a world and make choices that shape the storyline, influence character growth, and determine the ending.

---

## 📖 Overview

TextVenture allows players to fully immerse themselves in a branching narrative.  
Every decision leads to different scenarios, encouraging:

- Exploration  
- Critical thinking  
- Replayability  
- Unique multiple endings

## 🧩 OOP Concepts Applied

### **Encapsulation**
Player attributes such as **respect**, **fear**, and **courage** are kept private in the `GameState` class and modified only through methods like `addRespect()` and `addFear()`.

### **Inheritance**
An abstract `Path` class contains shared structures used by all story paths.  
`Path1`, `Path2`, and `Path3` extend this class and implement their own unique `playPath()` logic.

### **Polymorphism**
Each path uses the same `playPath()` method name but implements different story flows, resulting in distinct narratives per player choice.

### **Abstraction**
Classes like `DelayPrinter` and `LoadingBar` hide complex animation or printing logic, giving cleaner usage throughout the program.
